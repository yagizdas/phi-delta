Maintaining good hygiene\npractices not only reduces the chances of contracting a disease but could also\nreduce the risk of spreading illness within the community. Given the current\npandemic, daily habits such as washing hands or taking regular showers have\ntaken primary importance among people, especially for the elderly population\nliving alone at home or in an assisted living facility. This paper presents a\nnovel and non-invasive framework for monitoring human hygiene using vibration\nsensors where we adopt Machine Learning techniques. The approach is based on a\ncombination of a geophone sensor, a digitizer, and a cost-efficient computer\nboard in a practical enclosure. Monitoring daily hygiene routines may help\nhealthcare professionals be proactive rather than reactive in identifying and\ncontrolling the spread of potential outbreaks within the community. The\nexperimental result indicates that applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for\nbinary classification exhibits a promising accuracy of ~95% in the\nclassification of different hygiene habits. Furthermore, both tree-based\nclassifier (Random Forrest and Decision Tree) outperforms other models by\nachieving the highest accuracy (100%), which means that classifying hygiene\nevents using vibration and non-invasive sensors is possible for monitoring\nhygiene activity.\nArXiv ID: 2207.03529v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03529v1\n\n---\nTitle: A Study on the Impact of Gender, Employment Status and Academic Discipline on Cyber Hygiene: A Case Study of University of Nigeria, Nsukka\nAuthors: Celestine Ugwu, Modesta Ezema, Uchenna Ome, Lizzy Ofusori, Comfort Olebera, Elochukwu Ukwandu\nPublished: 2023-05-30\nSummary: The COVID19 pandemic has helped amplify the importance of Cyber Hygiene. As\nthe reliance on the Internet and IT services increased during the pandemic.\nThis in turn has introduced a new wave of criminal activities such as\ncybercrimes. With the emergent of COVID19 which lead to increase in\ncyberattacks incidents, the pattern and sophistication, there is an urgent need\nto carry out an exploratory study to find out users level of cyber-hygiene\nknowledge and culture based on gender, employment status and academic\ndiscipline. Above this, with many organisations providing for dual mode work\npattern or remote and in-person as the pandemic subsides, this study remains\nvery relevant and hence the aim to investigate the cyber hygiene knowledge and\ncompliance of university students and employees of the University of Nigeria,\nNsukka (UNN). In addition, it attempts to verify the relationship between\ndemographics such as gender, employment status and academic discipline on cyber\nhygiene culture among students and employees. The sample population is made of\nemployees and students of UNN, where the employees are either academic staff or\nnon-academic staff. The sample size consisted of three hundred and sixteen\n(316) participants, one hundred and eight-seven (187) of whom were females and\none hundred and twenty-nine (129) were males. The results offer some useful\ninsight on cyber hygiene practices at the university.\nArXiv ID: 2305.19300v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19300v1\n\n---\nTitle: Effectiveness of Testing, Tracing, Social Distancing and Hygiene in Tackling Covid-19 in India: A System Dynamics Model\nAuthors: Jayendran Venkateswaran, Om Damani\nPublished: 2020-04-19\nSummary: We present a System Dynamics (SD) model of the Covid-19 pandemic spread in\nIndia. The detailed age-structured compartment-based model endogenously\ncaptures various disease transmission pathways, expanding significantly from\nthe standard SEIR model. The model is customized for India by using the\nappropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices, external arrivals (as\nper actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the reported\ncases of Covid-19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent\ntime-variant levers, the effects of testing, contact tracing, isolating\nCovid-positive patients, quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices,\nsocial distancing through contact rate reductions at distinct zones of home(H),\nwork(W), school(S) and other(O) locations. Simulation results show that, even\nafter an extended lock-down, some non-trivial number of infections (even\nasymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tools that\nwork against the pandemic is high rate of testing of those who show Covid-19\nlike symptoms, isolating them if they are positive and contact tracing all\ncontacts of positive patients and quarantining them, in combination with use of\nface masks and personal hygiene. A wide range of combination of effectiveness\nof contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal hygiene measures help\nminimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in implementation of one\nmeasure can be compensated by better implementation of other measures.\nArXiv ID: 2004.08859v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08859v1\n\n---\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nPublished: 2021-02-18\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics. At the same time, new challenges create new\nopportunities and research directions, e.g. renewed interest in non-constrained\niris or periocular recognition, touch-less fingerprint- and vein-based\nauthentication and the use of biometric characteristics for disease detection.\nThis article presents an overview of the research carried out to address those\nchallenges and emerging opportunities.\nArXiv ID: 2102.09258v2\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09258v2\n\n---\nTitle: Reward Design For An Online Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Supporting Oral Self-Care\nAuthors: Anna L. Trella, Kelly W. Zhang, Inbal Nahum-Shani, Vivek Shetty, Finale Doshi-Velez, Susan A. Murphy\nPublished: 2022-08-15\nSummary: Dental disease is one of the most common chronic diseases despite being\nlargely preventable. However, professional advice on optimal oral hygiene\npractices is often forgotten or abandoned by patients. Therefore patients may\nbenefit from timely and personalized encouragement to engage in oral self-care\nbehaviors. In this paper, we develop an online reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithm for use in optimizing the delivery of mobile-based prompts to\nencourage oral hygiene behaviors. One of the main challenges in developing such\nan algorithm is ensuring that the algorithm considers the impact of the current\naction on the effectiveness of future actions (i.e., delayed effects),\nespecially when the algorithm has been made simple in order to run stably and\nautonomously in a constrained, real-world setting (i.e., highly noisy, sparse\ndata). We address this challenge by designing a quality reward which maximizes\nthe desired health outcome (i.e., high-quality brushing) while minimizing user\nburden. We also highlight a procedure for optimizing the hyperparameters of the\nreward by building a simulation environment test bed and evaluating candidates\nusing the test bed. The RL algorithm discussed in this paper will be deployed\nin Oralytics, an oral self-care app that provides behavioral strategies to\nboost patient engagement in oral hygiene practices.\nArXiv ID: 2208.07406v3\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07406v3\n"
