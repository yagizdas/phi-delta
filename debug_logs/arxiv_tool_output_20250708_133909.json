In order to\nsystematically collect and analyse public opinion on food safety, we developed\nIFoodCloud, a platform for the real-time sentiment analysis of public opinion\non food safety in China. It collects data from more than 3,100 public sources\nthat can be used to explore public opinion trends, public sentiment, and\nregional attention differences of food safety incidents. At the same time, we\nconstructed a sentiment classification model using multiple lexicon-based and\ndeep learning-based algorithms integrated with IFoodCloud that provide an\nunprecedented rapid means of understanding the public sentiment toward specific\nfood safety incidents. Our best model's F1-score achieved 0.9737. Further,\nthree real-world cases are presented to demonstrate the application and\nrobustness. IFoodCloud could be considered a valuable tool for promote\nscientisation of food safety supervision and risk communication.\nArXiv ID: 2102.11033v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11033v1\n\n---\nTitle: AI-enabled Efficient and Safe Food Supply Chain\nAuthors: Ilianna Kollia, Jack Stevenson, Stefanos Kollias\nPublished: 2021-05-01\nSummary: This paper provides a review of an emerging field in the food processing\nsector, referring to efficient and safe food supply chains, from farm to fork,\nas enabled by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent advances in machine and deep\nlearning are used for effective food production, energy management and food\nlabeling. Appropriate deep neural architectures are adopted and used for this\npurpose, including Fully Convolutional Networks, Long Short-Term Memories and\nRecurrent Neural Networks, Auto-Encoders and Attention mechanisms, Latent\nVariable extraction and clustering, as well as Domain Adaptation. Three\nexperimental studies are presented, illustrating the ability of these AI\nmethodologies to produce state-of-the-art performance in the whole food supply\nchain. In particular, these concern: (i) predicting plant growth and tomato\nyield in greenhouses, thus matching food production to market needs and\nreducing food waste or food unavailability; (ii) optimizing energy consumption\nacross large networks of food retail refrigeration systems, through optimal\nselection of systems that can get shut-down and through prediction of the\nrespective food de-freezing times, during peaks of power demand load; (iii)\noptical recognition and verification of food consumption expiry date in\nautomatic inspection of retail packaged food, thus ensuring safety of food and\npeople's health.\nArXiv ID: 2105.00333v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00333v1\n\n---\nTitle: Supporting 'Good Habits' through User-Led Design of Food Safety Applications - Findings from a Survey of Red Meat Consumers\nAuthors: Adeola Bamgboje-Ayodele, Leonie Ellis, Paul Turner\nPublished: 2016-05-28\nSummary: Mitigating consumer health risks and reducing food wastage has stimulated\nresearch into mechanisms for improving consumers' food safety knowledge and\nfood management practice. Many studies report success, but differences in\nmethodology and in the type and range of foods and consumers involved has made\ncomparison and transferability of results challenging. While most studies\nadvocate for the importance of information in consumer education, few provide\ndetailed insight into what 'good' information means. Determining appropriate\ncontent, formats, and methods of delivery for different types of consumers as\nwell as evaluating how different choices impact on consumers' food safety\nknowledge and behaviour remains unclear. Within a larger research project on\nenhancing provenance, stability and traceability of red meat value chains, this\npaper presents findings from a survey of Australian red meat consumers (n=217).\nIt identifies consumers' food safety issues and reveals information and\ncommunication preferences that may support good safety habits with food.\nArXiv ID: 1606.00886v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00886v1\n\n---\nTitle: Extracting chemical food safety hazards from the scientific literature automatically using large language models\nAuthors: Neris Ã–zen, Wenjuan Mu, Esther D. van Asselt, Leonieke M. van den Bulk\nPublished: 2024-05-01\nSummary: The number of scientific articles published in the domain of food safety has\nconsistently been increasing over the last few decades. It has therefore become\nunfeasible for food safety experts to read all relevant literature related to\nfood safety and the occurrence of hazards in the food chain. However, it is\nimportant that food safety experts are aware of the newest findings and can\naccess this information in an easy and concise way. In this study, an approach\nis presented to automate the extraction of chemical hazards from the scientific\nliterature through large language models. The large language model was used\nout-of-the-box and applied on scientific abstracts; no extra training of the\nmodels or a large computing cluster was required. Three different styles of\nprompting the model were tested to assess which was the most optimal for the\ntask at hand. The prompts were optimized with two validation foods (leafy\ngreens and shellfish) and the final performance of the best prompt was\nevaluated using three test foods (dairy, maize and salmon). The specific\nwording of the prompt was found to have a considerable effect on the results. A\nprompt breaking the task down into smaller steps performed best overall. This\nprompt reached an average accuracy of 93% and contained many chemical\ncontaminants already included in food monitoring programs, validating the\nsuccessful retrieval of relevant hazards for the food safety domain. The\nresults showcase how valuable large language models can be for the task of\nautomatic information extraction from the scientific literature.\nArXiv ID: 2405.15787v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15787v1\n\n---\nTitle: Application of Blockchain and Internet of Things to Ensure Tamper-Proof Data Availability for Food Safety\nAuthors: Adnan Iftekhar, Xiaohui Cui, Mir Hassan, Wasif Afzal\nPublished: 2020-06-01\nSummary: Food supply chain plays a vital role in human health and food prices. Food\nsupply chain inefficiencies in terms of unfair competition and lack of\nregulations directly affect the quality of human life and increase food safety\nrisks. This work merges Hyperledger Fabric, an enterprise-ready blockchain\nplatform with existing conventional infrastructure, to trace a food package\nfrom farm to fork using an identity unique for each food package while keeping\nit uncomplicated. It keeps the records of business transactions that are\nsecured and accessible to stakeholders according to the agreed set of policies\nand rules without involving any centralized authority. This paper focuses on\nexploring and building an uncomplicated, low-cost solution to quickly link the\nexisting food industry at different geographical locations in a chain to track\nand trace the food in the market.\nArXiv ID: 2006.01307v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01307v1\n"
