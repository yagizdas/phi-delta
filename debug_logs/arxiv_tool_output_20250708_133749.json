Accessibility to the food\nassistance programs is impacted by demographics of the population and geography\nof the location. It hence becomes imperative to define and identify food\nassistance deserts (Under-served areas) within a given region to find out the\nways to improve the accessibility of food. Food banks, the supplier of food to\nthe food agencies serving the people, can manage its resources more efficiently\nby targeting the food assistance deserts and increase the food supply in those\nregions. This paper will examine the characteristics and structure of the food\nassistance network in the region of Ohio by presenting the possible reasons of\nfood insecurity in this region and identify areas wherein food agencies are\nneeded or may not be needed. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering technique\nis employed to identify the possible reasons and address this problem of food\naccessibility.\nArXiv ID: 1909.09453v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09453v1\n\n---\nTitle: Where to Build Food Banks and Pantries: A Two-Level Machine Learning Approach\nAuthors: Gavin Ruan, Ziqi Guo, Guang Lin\nPublished: 2024-10-20\nSummary: Over 44 million Americans currently suffer from food insecurity, of whom 13\nmillion are children. Across the United States, thousands of food banks and\npantries serve as vital sources of food and other forms of aid for food\ninsecure families. By optimizing food bank and pantry locations, food would\nbecome more accessible to families who desperately require it. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel two-level optimization framework, which utilizes the\nK-Medoids clustering algorithm in conjunction with the Open-Source Routing\nMachine engine, to optimize food bank and pantry locations based on real road\ndistances to houses and house blocks. Our proposed framework also has the\nadaptability to factor in considerations such as median household income using\na pseudo-weighted K-Medoids algorithm. Testing conducted with California and\nIndiana household data, as well as comparisons with real food bank and pantry\nlocations showed that interestingly, our proposed framework yields food pantry\nlocations superior to those of real existing ones and saves significant\ndistance for households, while there is a marginal penalty on the first level\nfood bank to food pantry distance. Overall, we believe that the second-level\nbenefits of this framework far outweigh any drawbacks and yield a net benefit\nresult.\nArXiv ID: 2410.15420v1\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15420v1\n\n---\nTitle: Semi-Automatic Crowdsourcing Tool for Online Food Image Collection and Annotation\nAuthors: Zeman Shao, Runyu Mao, Fengqing Zhu\nPublished: 2019-10-11\nSummary: Assessing dietary intake accurately remains an open and challenging research\nproblem. In recent years, image-based approaches have been developed to\nautomatically estimate food intake by capturing eat occasions with mobile\ndevices and wearable cameras. To build a reliable machine-learning models that\ncan automatically map pixels to calories, successful image-based systems need\nlarge collections of food images with high quality groundtruth labels to\nimprove the learned models. In this paper, we introduce a semi-automatic system\nfor online food image collection and annotation. Our system consists of a web\ncrawler, an automatic food detection method and a web-based crowdsoucing tool.\nThe web crawler is used to download large sets of online food images based on\nthe given food labels. Since not all retrieved images contain foods, we\nintroduce an automatic food detection method to remove irrelevant images. We\ndesigned a web-based crowdsourcing tool to assist the crowd or human annotators\nto locate and label all the foods in the images. The proposed semi-automatic\nonline food image collection system can be used to build large food image\ndatasets with groundtruth labels efficiently from scratch.\nArXiv ID: 1910.05242v2\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05242v2\n"
